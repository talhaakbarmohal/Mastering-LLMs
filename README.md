# My LLM Learning Journey

Welcome to my LLM (Large Language Model) learning journey! This repository contains my notes, projects, and experiments as I explore the world of LLMs like GPT, BERT, and Transformer architectures.
I recently embarked on my journey to learn about Large Language Models (LLMs). This repository serves as a space to document my progress, experiments, and projects related to LLMs.
I will gradually share my progress and insights, starting with the basics and moving towards more complex implementations.
I have already completed 40% of my learning so far, and as I continue, I'll share my learnings, code demos, and any interesting projects I build along the way.

## Progress

â€” I've started understanding the basics of transformers, fine-tuning pre-trained models, and experimenting with different datasets.

## Goals

- Learn the fundamentals of LLMs (Architecture, Attention Mechanism, Pre-training, Fine-tuning)
- Build projects showcasing practical applications of LLMs (e.g., chatbots, sentiment analysis, text summarization)
- Understand model efficiency and optimization techniques

## Repo Structure
- **Notebooks/**: Hands-on experiments and code demos
- **Resources/**: Papers, books, tutorials, and links that helped me in my learning
- **Projects/**: Mini-projects showcasing practical LLM applications
- **Logs/**: My personal learning progress and reflections

## How to Contribute
Feel free to fork this repo, suggest improvements, or collaborate if you're learning LLMs too. Happy learning!
